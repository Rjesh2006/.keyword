 # These are some Keywords üóùÔ∏è :-- # 
 1.**Computation :**
 the use of computers, especially as a  subject of research or study.
 



2.**User space :**
User space usually refers to the various programs and libraries that the operating system uses to interact with the kernel: software that performs input/output, manipulates file system objects, application software, etc.



3.**Operating system :**
   An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer.

4.**Debian :**
Debian, also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993.



5.**Kali linux :**
Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing



6.**RISC :**
Reduce the cycles per instruction at the cost of the number of instructions per program. 



7.**CISC :**
The CISC approach attempts to minimize the number of instructions per program but at the cost of an increase in the number of cycles per instruction. 



8.**Risk-V :**
RISC-V (‚Äúrisk-five‚Äù) is an instruction set architecture (ISA) rooted in reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. RISC-V is unique, even revolutionary.



9 **ISA :**
An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is part of the abstract model of a computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software


10.**TYPES  OF SOURCE :**
 
   - **Closed source**
Closed source software refers to the computer software which source code is closes means public is not given access to the source code.
 
   - **Open source**
Nearly all open source software is free software, but there are exceptions.

11.**Enegy efficiency :**
*The term efficiency can be defined as the ability to achieve an end goal with little to no waste, effort, or energy*

**The most energy efficient programming languages:-**

12.**kernel :**
Kernel programming is nothing but. User space or application programming relies on the design that there is an operating system that provides a layer abstraction over hardware. 

   -**Linux kernel programming?**
Through kernel programming we can access or control the basic subsystems of kernel like, scheduling, memory management, file system management, networking management, inter-process communication etc. We can develop seprate kernel also.



13.**DNS :**
Domain Name System (DNS) is a hostname for IP address translation service



14.**IP ADDRESS :**
a unique string of characters that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
  - Types of ip address:-

15.**Port no.**

A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a serve

 - **types of port number**:-

16.**Bare metal**
a form of cloud services in which the user rents a physical machine from a provider that is not shared with any other tenants.



17.**Hypeevisor**
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs)

  - types of hypervisor:-
  - type 1:
  
  -   Type 1 hypervisor, is virtualization software that has been installed directly onto the computing hardware. This type of hypervisor controls not only the hardware, but one or more guest operating systems (OSes).

   
  - type2:
    
  - A type 2 hypervisor is hosted, running as software on the O/S, which in turn runs on the physical hardware. This form of hypervisor is typically used to run multiple operating systems on one personal computer,

18.**FPGA**
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) 



19.**Socket**

The word ‚ÄúSocket‚Äù is the combination of port and IP address. The word ‚ÄúPort‚Äù is the number used by particular software.



20.**OSI**

The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.



21.**SEVEN LAYER OF OSI[OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION]**


layer7-application/protocol

layer6-presentation

layer5-cryptography

layer4-port number[16 bits]

layer3-IP ADDRESS[32 bits]

layer2-hardware address-NIC,MAC

layer1-digital(1 and 0)



22.**tcpi model**
The TCP/IP model refers to the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model.
