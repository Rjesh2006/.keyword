 # These are some Keywords üóùÔ∏è :-- # 
 1.**Computation**
 
 the use of computers, especially as a   subject of research or study.
 Origin



2.**User space**
User space usually refers to the various programs and libraries that the operating system uses to interact with the kernel: software that performs input/output, manipulates file system objects, application software, etc.



3.**Operating system**
   An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer.

4.**Debian**
Debian, also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993.



5.**Kali linux**
Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing



6.**RISC**
Reduce the cycles per instruction at the cost of the number of instructions per program. 



7.**CISC**
The CISC approach attempts to minimize the number of instructions per program but at the cost of an increase in the number of cycles per instruction. 



8.**Risk-V**
RISC-V (‚Äúrisk-five‚Äù) is an instruction set architecture (ISA) rooted in reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. RISC-V is unique, even revolutionary.



9 **ISA**
An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is part of the abstract model of a computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software


10.**TYPES  OF SOURCE**
 
   **Closed source**
Closed source software refers to the computer software which source code is closes means public is not given access to the source code.
 
   **Open source**
Nearly all open source software is free software, but there are exceptions.

11.**Enegy efficiency**
*The term efficiency can be defined as the ability to achieve an end goal with little to no waste, effort, or energy*

**The most energy efficient programming languages:-**

12.**kernel**
Kernel programming is nothing but. User space or application programming relies on the design that there is an operating system that provides a layer abstraction over hardware. 

   --**Linux kernel programming?**
Through kernel programming we can access or control the basic subsystems of kernel like, scheduling, memory management, file system management, networking management, inter-process communication etc. We can develop seprate kernel also.



13.**DNS**
Domain Name System (DNS) is a hostname for IP address translation service



14.**IP ADDRESS**
a unique string of characters that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.
  - Types of ip address:-
