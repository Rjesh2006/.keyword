 # These are some Keywords üóùÔ∏è :-- # 
 1.**Computation :**
 the use of computers, especially as a  subject of research or study.
 



2.**User space :**
User space usually refers to the various programs and libraries that the operating system uses to interact with the kernel: software that performs input/output, manipulates file system objects, application software, etc.



3.**Operating system :**
   An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer.
